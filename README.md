# React Native YouTube Video Player ðŸ”¥
This is a plugin for React Native making playing YouTube video in React Native without pain.

Developers can easily modify the player according to their app (till an extent), and choose options they want to show in YouTube player.

```js
import YouTubePlayer from 'rn-yt-player';
